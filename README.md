# ROS-based Robotic Navigation using ArUco Markers and Logical Cameras

In this project, the goal is to implement a robotic navigation system using the Robot Operating System (ROS) with the TurtleBot equipped with an RGB camera, ArUco markers, and static logical cameras. The robot will navigate through an environment by detecting ArUco markers using its RGB camera. The information from the ArUco markers will be utilized to retrieve specific parameters stored in a YAML file, guiding the robot through a predefined sequence of poses. The logical cameras provide additional environmental information for enhanced situational awareness. The project involves creating a ROS package, writing nodes for marker detection, parameter retrieval, and logical camera integration, and implementing an action client for precise robotic navigation. The outcome will be a fully functional robotic system capable of autonomously moving through specified waypoints based on ArUco marker information. This project not only explores ROS functionalities but also integrates computer vision, parameter management, and logical camera usage for a comprehensive robotic navigation solution.
